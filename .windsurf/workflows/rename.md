description: Rename or  create a naming for anything the user wants so that everything has a unique identifier for easy editing
---

1. Find the exact component the user is talking about or referring to.
2. Use standardised naming convention for every individual element that makes up the component as well as containers, wrappers, nesting, divs, elements, flex boxes, tesct flds, headers and any other general building mechanism for websites or tools that need to be named effectively.
3. It is vital to double check with the user that you know what component or element etc they are referring to and then proceeed tro name change.
4. Now you need to check and ensure taht none of these names affect the code or project in a way that would break it. If needed proceed to change the names in all the appropriate references and uses of that element or component and ensure that there is full working functionality once you have made the update.
