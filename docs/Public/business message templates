WhatsApp Template Message Guidelines to Follow
WhatsApp Template Message Guidelines
One might presume that framing a WhatsApp Business Message Template is all about creativity and business manifestation, but in reality, it is not so. There are plenty of technicalities to abide by. The basic guideline to follow is not to make your message too promotional or include any insensitive content in the message. 

Here is a list of the essential guidelines to follow to prevent your WhatsApp Business Message template from being rejected:

Grammar and Spelling: A great WhatsApp Business message template should not include any spelling or grammar mistakes. Ensure that you proofread the content well before submitting the same for approval. Incorrect grammar and spelling mistakes and even wrongly placed punctuation marks can qualify a message as spam, leading to straight away rejection. 
Business URL: The business URL included in the message should be a publicly accessible one and belong to the same business brand that is forwarding the message. Also, refrain from using any type of URL shortener or adding unnecessary lines and spaces. Incorrect URL format or spamming will surely lead to the rejection of the message. 
Appropriate Language Relevant to the Content: While submitting the message template for approval, the brand has to select the language of the message, and this should essentially comply with the language used in the content of the message. Also, ensure that only one single language is used for framing the WhatsApp business message template. The mixture of two or more languages is not an acceptable format. 
Using Variables and Parameters: Align to the perfect use of parameters and variables while framing the message template. When typing the variables, make sure you insert just the right number of curly brackets. Including texts within the parameters is also necessary to form the correct format of the template message.
Common Rejection Reasons of the WhatsApp Business Message Templates
Here are some of the common reasons for which WhatsApp business message templates may face rejection as per the official guidelines by Meta:

If the variable parameters contain some special characters or feature braces that are curly and mismatched. 
The template may get rejected if it has some violations of the WhatsApp Commerce Policies. The product descriptions, fees, and prices of the products should be related to only the one that is being sold. Anything otherwise should be avoided. 
Any message that asks for the personal details of the users, including their financial details such as card numbers, will be instantly rejected by WhatsApp.
Messages containing any hate speech or any message that threatens the sentiments of the users will be rejected by WhatsApp. 
Plagiarism is usually not tolerated by WhatsApp. So, any template that is an exact duplicate of any existing copy of the template will not be accepted.
