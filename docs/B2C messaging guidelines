Mastering WhatsApp Message Formatting: A Developer's 
Guide to Training an Expert LLM for B2C Communication 
I. Introduction: Equipping Your LLM for Expert WhatsApp 
Formatting 
A. The Strategic Imperative of Formatting in B2C WhatsApp Communication 
In the dynamic and personal realm of Business-to-Consumer (B2C) WhatsApp 
communication, the visual presentation of a message carries significant weight, often 
equaling the importance of its content. Message formatting transcends mere 
decoration; it serves as an indispensable instrument for enhancing clarity, boosting 
engagement, and compelling action within these interactions.1 Properly formatted 
messages not only improve readability but also project an image of professionalism, 
which can substantially influence customer perception and elevate response rates.3 
The immediate nature of WhatsApp means users often scan messages quickly; 
effective formatting ensures that key information is absorbed efficiently and that the 
overall communication experience is positive. 
The way a brand communicates through this channel, including its attention to 
formatting detail, directly shapes how it is perceived. Inconsistent, sloppy, or poorly 
considered formatting, even if the underlying message content is sound, can 
inadvertently portray a brand as unprofessional or careless. This can erode customer 
trust and diminish the perceived value of the communication.5 In essence, the LLM 
responsible for formatting these messages acts as a digital brand ambassador. Its 
ability to format "perfectly" is therefore not just a technical achievement but a crucial 
component of maintaining and enhancing brand equity. Every formatted message is a 
touchpoint that contributes to the cumulative customer experience. 
B. Defining "Expert Formatting" for an LLM 
Achieving "expert formatting" for a Large Language Model (LLM) extends far beyond 
the mere application of syntactical rules. An expert LLM must grasp the subtleties 
inherent in B2C communication, comprehending the context, the intended emotional 
resonance, and the precise objective of each message dispatched.8 It is not sufficient 
for the LLM to know how to bold text; it must discern when bolding is the most 
effective choice to achieve a specific communicative goal and why that choice is 
superior to others, or to no formatting at all. 
This advanced capability requires the LLM to make nuanced judgments, mirroring the 
decision-making processes of a human communication expert. For example, an LLM 
demonstrating "perfect" formatting would understand that while bold text can 
emphasize a call to action, overusing it throughout a message diminishes its impact 
and can make the message appear aggressive or difficult to read. This implies a need 
for the LLM to not only apply formatting rules but also to, in a sense, evaluate the 
potential effectiveness of its output based on established B2C communication 
principles. The development process, therefore, should ideally incorporate 
mechanisms for the LLM to learn from feedback or to score its formatting choices 
against qualitative benchmarks during its training phase, moving beyond simple 
syntactical correctness. 
C. Purpose and Scope of This Guideline 
This document is designed to furnish the AI developer with the essential knowledge, 
precise rules, and underlying justifications required to train an LLM to attain this 
sophisticated level of formatting expertise specifically for B2C WhatsApp messages. 
The scope encompasses all native WhatsApp formatting options, their strategic 
deployment in various B2C scenarios (including promotional messages, transactional 
updates, and customer service interactions), best practices for maximizing clarity and 
engagement, common pitfalls that can lead to miscommunication or message 
rejection, and the rationale underpinning optimal formatting decisions. 
D. How to Use This Guideline for LLM Development 
The principles, rules, and illustrative examples detailed within this guideline are 
intended to be directly translatable into practical strategies for LLM development. This 
includes their use in constructing comprehensive training datasets, formulating 
explicit rule-sets to govern formatting logic, and potentially guiding fine-tuning 
processes for pre-trained LLMs. The aim is to provide a clear pathway for embedding 
deep formatting intelligence into the LLM, enabling it to autonomously produce 
messages that are not only correctly formatted but also strategically effective. 
II. Foundations: WhatsApp's Native Formatting Capabilities 
A. Overview of Available Formatting Options 
WhatsApp provides a core suite of text formatting tools that serve as the fundamental 
building blocks for creating messages that are clear, structured, and visually 
engaging. These native options include: Bold, Italics, Strikethrough, Monospace, 
Bulleted Lists, Numbered Lists, Block Quotes, and Inline Code.10 It is important to note 
that WhatsApp does not offer an option to disable these formatting features; any text 
entered using the correct syntax will be formatted accordingly.10 This inherent 
characteristic underscores the platform's design towards encouraging formatted 
communication. The easy availability of these tools to human users, often via simple 
shortcuts, suggests an expectation that messages, including B2C communications, 
will leverage formatting for improved clarity and impact. Consequently, an LLM 
producing unformatted or poorly formatted messages would likely be perceived as 
less professional or sophisticated compared to human-generated communications. 
B. Detailed Breakdown of Each Formatting Option 
A thorough understanding of each formatting option's syntax and primary function is 
essential for programming the LLM. 
● Bold: 
○ Syntax: Place an asterisk on both sides of the text: *text*.10 
○ Visual Example: Raw: *Important Update* Rendered: Important Update 
○ Primary Function: To emphasize key words or phrases, making them stand 
out. 
○ Alternative Application Methods: On mobile devices, users can often tap 
and hold text to access a formatting menu that includes Bold.10 (This is for 
contextual understanding of user behavior, not direct LLM implementation). 
● Italic: 
○ Syntax: Place an underscore on both sides of the text: _text_.10 
○ Visual Example: Raw: _New Collection_ Rendered: New Collection 
○ Primary Function: To provide subtle emphasis, often used for titles, foreign 
words, or to convey a specific tone. 
○ Alternative Application Methods: Similar to Bold, tap-and-hold shortcuts 
are often available.10 
● Strikethrough: 
○ Syntax: Place a tilde on both sides of the text: ~text~.10 
○ Visual Example: Raw: ~Was $50~ Rendered: ~Was $50~ 
○ Primary Function: To show corrections, deletions, or that certain information 
is no longer valid (e.g., an old price). 
● Monospace: 
○ Syntax: Place three backticks on both sides of the text: .10 
○ Visual Example: Raw: CODE123 Rendered: CODE123 
○ Primary Function: To display text in a fixed-width font, typically used for 
code snippets, technical terms, or pre-formatted text. 
● Bulleted List: 
○ Syntax: Place an asterisk or hyphen and a space before each list item: * item 
or - item.10 
○ Visual Example: Raw: * Feature 1 * Feature 2 Rendered: 
■ Feature 1 
■ Feature 2 
○ Primary Function: To present a list of items where the order is not critical. 
● Numbered List: 
○ Syntax: Place a number, a period, and a space before each list item: 1. item.10 
○ Visual Example: Raw: 1. Step one 2. Step two Rendered: 
1. Step one 
2. Step two 
○ Primary Function: To present a list of items where the order or sequence is 
important, such as instructions. 
● Block Quote: 
○ Syntax: Place an angle bracket and a space before the text: > text.10 
○ Visual Example: Raw: > This is a customer testimonial. Rendered:This is a 
customer testimonial. 
○ Primary Function: To set apart quoted text, testimonials, or important 
notices. 
● Inline Code: 
○ Syntax: Place a single backtick on both sides of the text: `text`.10 
○ Visual Example: Raw: Use the `submit` button. Rendered: Use the submit 
button. 
○ Primary Function: To highlight short pieces of code, commands, or specific 
technical terms within a sentence. 
The fact that these formatting features are always active and cannot be disabled 10 
presents a critical consideration for the LLM. It must be acutely aware that characters 
like *, _, ~, and ` will trigger formatting if used in the prescribed way. Therefore, the 
LLM needs explicit rules for situations where these characters are intended to be 
displayed literally as part of the message content (e.g., in product names like 
"Wonder_Widget", mathematical notations, or specific branding). This necessitates 
instructions on how to escape these characters, for instance, by using a backslash (\) 
before the special character, as indicated in some developer resources 12, to prevent 
unintended formatting and ensure message integrity. Failure to manage this can lead 
to corrupted messages, significantly undermining clarity and professionalism. 
C. Combining Formatting 
WhatsApp allows for the combination of certain formatting styles, such as applying 
both bold and italics to a piece of text (e.g., *_important note_* would render as 
important note). However, it's important for the LLM to understand that the 
monospace format typically overrides other formatting styles applied to the same 
text.13 If text is marked for monospace, any bold or italic formatting within that same 
segment will likely be ignored, and the text will render solely in monospace, potentially 
showing the formatting characters (like asterisks) literally. This is a key detail for the 
LLM to avoid generating messages with unexpected visual outputs. 
To consolidate this foundational knowledge, the following table outlines the syntax 
and primary purpose of each formatting option: 
Table 1: WhatsApp Formatting Syntax and Basic Usage

This table serves as a fundamental reference for the LLM, detailing the mechanics of 
applying each format. The "Syntax" column provides the "how," the "Visual Example" 
offers clear input/output pairs crucial for training and validation, and the "Primary 
Function" introduces a basic semantic understanding. This forms the initial layer of 
the LLM's knowledge base regarding WhatsApp formatting. 
III. Strategic Formatting for B2C Message Excellence: The "When, 
How, and Why" 
This section delves into the expert application of each formatting option, providing 
the LLM with the nuanced understanding required to make contextually appropriate 
and effective formatting decisions in B2C communication. The effectiveness of these 
formatting choices often connects to fundamental psychological principles of visual 
processing, where elements like bold text are perceived as more important or urgent 4, 
and italics can subtly influence recall or perceived sophistication.9 An LLM that 
implicitly understands these underpinnings will be better equipped to make optimal 
choices that go beyond simple pattern matching, truly enhancing the 
communication's impact. However, a key principle is moderation; overuse of any 
emphasis technique can diminish its effect and make messages appear cluttered or 
unprofessional.3 The LLM must learn this balance. 
A. Bold (*text*) 
● When to Use (Context & Triggers): 
○ Highlighting Key Information: Essential for drawing immediate attention to 
critical details such as order numbers, shipping statuses (e.g., "Your order has 
been shipped"), important alerts, or deadlines.11 
○ Emphasizing Calls to Action (CTAs): Crucial for making CTAs like "Shop 
Now", "Learn More", or "Contact Support" prominent and actionable.11 
○ Drawing Attention to Promotions/Offers: Effective for highlighting special 
deals, discounts, or limited-time offers, such as "Limited Time Offer!" or "Get 
20% OFF".11 
○ Creating Headlines/Subheadings: Useful for structuring longer messages, 
improving scannability by breaking text into logical sections with clear 
headers.11 
○ Brand Names or Product Names: Can be used for instant recognition, 
especially when introducing a brand or product within a message (e.g., 
"Welcome to Gallabox").5 
● How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples): 
○ IF message_segment_is_primary_cta THEN apply_bold(cta_phrase). Example: 
Input "Click here to track your order" -> Output "Click here to track your 
order" or "Click here to track your order". 
○ IF entity_type IS 'discount_value' OR entity_type IS 'offer_keyword' (e.g., "Sale", 
"Free") THEN apply_bold(entity_text). Example: "Get 20% off this week" -> 
"Get 20% off this week". 
○ IF information_type IS 'order_confirmation_number' OR information_type IS 
'tracking_id_label' THEN apply_bold(information_text). Example: "Your order 
number is ORD12345" -> "Your order number is ORD12345". 
○ IF text_is_intended_as_section_header THEN apply_bold(header_text). 
● Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact): 
○ Bold text has a strong visual weight that immediately captures the reader's 
attention, significantly increasing the probability that the emphasized 
information will be noticed and processed, especially in the fast-paced 
environment of WhatsApp.11 
○ From a psychological perspective, bold typography is associated with 
strength, importance, and authority.4 This makes the bolded content appear 
more significant and can lend urgency or weight to CTAs and critical alerts. 
○ It greatly improves the scannability of messages, allowing users to quickly 
identify the most salient points without reading every word.1 
B. Italics (_text_) 
● When to Use (Context & Triggers): 
○ Subtle Emphasis: Ideal for highlighting a word or phrase when a less forceful 
emphasis than bold is desired. For instance, "We are very excited to 
announce...".11 
○ Product Names/Titles: Commonly used for names of books, films, specific 
software features, or distinct service packages (e.g., "Check out our Summer 
Collection").11 
○ Foreign Words/Phrases: Appropriate for setting apart non-native words or 
phrases used within a sentence (e.g., "Our new dessert is a panna cotta.").11 
○ Defining Terms or Introducing New Concepts: Useful when introducing a 
specific term or feature name for the first time, e.g., "Our platform now 
includes SmartAnalytics." 
○ Adding a Touch of Sophistication or Nuance: Can be employed to subtly 
alter the tone, making it feel more refined or to emphasize a particular quality. 
● How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples): 
○ IF emphasis_requirement IS 'subtle' AND text_segment IS target_for_emphasis 
THEN apply_italics(text_segment). 
○ IF entity_type IS 'book_title' OR entity_type IS 'product_name_within_sentence' 
OR entity_type IS 'foreign_term' THEN apply_italics(entity_text). Example: 
"Read our guide on Advanced Gardening Techniques." 
● Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact): 
○ Italics offer a softer visual cue compared to bold, making them suitable for 
conveying nuance or gentle emphasis without disrupting the flow of the text 
as much as bold might.11 
○ This formatting can lend a sense of refinement or call specific attention to 
terminology. Some research even suggests that italics can be effective for 
promoting offers 16 and may influence information recall, although legibility 
remains a key factor to consider to avoid making text harder to read.9 
C. Strikethrough (~text~) 
● When to Use (Context & Triggers): 
○ Showing Price Reductions: A very common and effective use, clearly 
indicating a discount: "Special Offer: ~$99~ $69!".11 
○ Indicating Corrections or Updates: Useful for showing that previous 
information is no longer current: "Event date changed from ~Oct 15~ to Oct 
22.".11 
○ Highlighting Sold-Out Items or Limited Availability: Can be used to show 
items that are no longer available or to create urgency: "Red Scarf: ~Sold 
Out~. Blue Scarf: Only 3 left!".11 
○ Showing a Change of Opinion or Humorous Retraction: This should be 
used cautiously in B2C contexts as it can be perceived as unprofessional if not 
handled well. Example: "We planned for a ~small~ HUGE surprise!" 
● How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples): 
○ IF message_segment CONTAINS 'original_price_indicator' THEN 
apply_strikethrough(price_value_associated_with_indicator). Example: "Was 
$100, Now $75" -> "Was ~$100~, Now $75". 
○ IF message_purpose IS 'update_information' AND text_segment IS 
'outdated_information' THEN apply_strikethrough(text_segment). 
● Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact): 
○ Strikethrough provides an unambiguous visual cue that information has been 
changed, is no longer valid, or represents a previous state (like an old price), 
which enhances transparency with the customer.11 
○ In sales contexts, displaying a struck-out original price alongside a new, lower 
price can effectively highlight the value of a discount and create a sense of 
urgency. 
D. Monospace () 
● When to Use (Context & Triggers): 
○ Displaying Codes: Ideal for coupon codes, discount codes, tracking 
numbers, product SKUs, serial numbers, or any short alphanumeric string that 
benefits from clear, unambiguous representation (e.g., "Your coupon code is 
SAVE25NOW").11 
○ Technical Information/Commands: While less frequent in general B2C 
messages, it's valuable for businesses offering technical products or support 
where specific commands or parameters need to be conveyed accurately 
(e.g., "Enter /help for assistance").11 
○ Short, Pre-formatted Text Snippets: Useful when the exact spacing and 
character representation of a small piece of text is important and should not 
be altered by proportional fonts. 
● How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples): 
○ IF entity_type IS 'discount_code' OR entity_type IS 'order_tracking_code' OR 
entity_type IS 'product_sku' THEN apply_monospace(entity_text). Example: 
"Use code VIP2024" -> "Use code VIP2024". 
● Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact): 
○ Monospace font visually isolates technical or code-like text from the 
surrounding narrative text. This improves readability and significantly reduces 
the chance of errors if the customer needs to transcribe the code.11 
○ The fixed-width nature of monospace ensures that characters like 'I', 'l', '1' or 
'O', '0' are more easily distinguishable, which is crucial for the accuracy of 
codes and technical data. 
E. Bulleted Lists (* text or - text) 
● When to Use (Context & Triggers): 
○ Listing Features or Benefits: Excellent for presenting multiple product 
features, service benefits, or advantages in an easy-to-digest format where 
the order of items is not paramount.3 
○ Short, Scannable Points: When conveying several distinct pieces of 
information that don't require a specific sequence. 
○ Presenting Options or Choices: Clearly laying out different choices available 
to the customer. 
● How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples): 
○ IF message_content_type IS 'list_of_product_features' AND 
item_order_is_not_significant THEN format_as_bulleted_list(feature_items). 
○ Each item in the list must begin with * (asterisk followed by a space) or - 
(hyphen followed by a space). 
○ Example: "Our plan includes: Unlimited Data, Free Setup, 24/7 Support" -> 
"Our plan includes: * Unlimited Data * Free Setup * 24/7 Support" 
● Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact): 
○ Bulleted lists break up potentially dense blocks of text, making complex 
information significantly more digestible and scannable, especially on mobile 
screens.3 
○ They improve comprehension by visually organizing related points, allowing 
users to quickly grasp the main takeaways. 
F. Numbered Lists (1. text) 
● When to Use (Context & Triggers): 
○ Step-by-Step Instructions: Essential for guiding users through a process, 
such as how to use a product, complete a setup, or redeem an offer.11 
○ Ranked Items or Prioritized Information: When the sequence or order of 
items is meaningful (e.g., "Top 3 reasons to upgrade:"). 
○ Enumerating a Specific Count of Items: Clearly indicating a set number of 
points, e.g., "Follow these 4 easy steps:". 
● How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples): 
○ IF message_content_type IS 'procedural_instructions' OR 
message_content_type IS 'sequential_steps_guide' THEN 
format_as_numbered_list(instruction_items). 
○ Each item in the list must begin with N. (a number, followed by a period, 
followed by a space). 
○ Example: "To reset: Turn off device. Wait 10 seconds. Turn on device." -> "To 
reset: 1. Turn off device. 2. Wait 10 seconds. 3. Turn on device." 
● Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact): 
○ Numbered lists are indispensable for clarity when presenting information that 
has a required sequence or involves following a procedure.11 
○ They logically guide the user through a process, reducing confusion and 
increasing the likelihood of successful completion of the task. 
G. Block Quotes (> text) 
● When to Use (Context & Triggers): 
○ Highlighting Customer Testimonials: If a brief and impactful testimonial is 
included in a message, block quotes can give it prominence.11 
○ Emphasizing Important Notices or Disclaimers: Useful for drawing special 
attention to critical pieces of information, such as policy changes or warnings 
(e.g., > Please note: Our office will be closed on Monday.).11 
○ Quoting a Previous Message or Statement for Context: While less 
common in proactive B2C messaging, it can be useful in customer support 
dialogues to refer back to a user's earlier statement. 
● How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples): 
○ IF message_segment_category IS 'customer_quote' OR 
message_segment_category IS 'critical_notice_within_message' THEN 
format_as_block_quote(segment_text). 
○ The text to be quoted must be preceded by > (angle bracket followed by a 
space). 
○ Example: "Our customer said: This product is amazing!" -> > Our customer 
said: This product is amazing! 
● Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact): 
○ Block quotes visually separate the quoted or emphasized text from the main 
body of the message, giving it distinct prominence and drawing the reader's 
eye.11 
○ When used for testimonials, this formatting can enhance credibility and make 
the endorsement stand out. 
H. Inline Code (`text`) 
● When to Use (Context & Triggers): 
○ Highlighting Short Specific Keywords, Commands, or Technical Terms 
Within a Sentence: Useful for drawing attention to specific interactive 
elements like button names, menu options, or brief technical terms without 
the formality of full monospace (e.g., "Please click the `Confirm` button to 
continue.").11 
○ Referring to Specific Field Names or Variables: When discussing form 
f
 ields or data points within a sentence (e.g., "Enter your `UserID` in the field 
provided."). 
● How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples): 
○ IF text_segment_is_ui_element_name_in_sentence OR 
text_segment_is_short_technical_keyword_in_sentence THEN 
apply_inline_code(text_segment). 
○ Example: "Check the status under My Orders." -> "Check the status under `My 
Orders`." 
● Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact): 
○ Inline code provides a subtle yet clear visual distinction for specific terms 
embedded within a sentence, differentiating them from the narrative text 
without the more significant visual break of the full three-backtick monospace 
format.11 
○ It is particularly effective for drawing attention to clickable elements, specific 
data inputs, or key terms that users need to identify within a larger context. 
I. Strategic Use of Emojis in B2C Messages 
Emojis, while not a traditional formatting tool, play a significant role in shaping the 
tone and readability of WhatsApp messages. Their use must be strategic and 
context-aware. 
● When to Use (Context & Triggers): 
○ Adding Emotional Tone and Personality: Emojis can make messages feel 
friendlier, more empathetic, celebratory, or welcoming.1 For example, a 
welcome message might include a 
�
�
 or 
�
�
 18, while birthday greetings could 
use 
�
�
 .18 
○ Drawing Attention to Key Points or CTAs (Sparingly): A well-chosen, 
relevant emoji placed near a CTA can provide a gentle visual nudge (e.g., 
"View our new arrivals 
➡
 ").12 
○ Replacing Words for Brevity (Use with Extreme Caution): While emojis like 
�
�
 can sometimes replace "okay" or "got it," this should be used very 
sparingly in B2C to avoid ambiguity. 
○ Visual Break and Engagement: Emojis can make messages more visually 
appealing and break the monotony of text, potentially increasing 
engagement.3 
● How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples): 
○ IF message_intent IS 'friendly_greeting' AND brand_voice_allows_informality 
THEN consider_adding_emoji(e.g., 
�
�
 , 
�
�
 ). 
○ IF message_purpose IS 'celebratory_announcement' (e.g., anniversary, 
milestone) THEN consider_adding_emoji(e.g., 
�
�
 , 
✨
 ). 
○ RULE: Limit emoji usage to a maximum of 1-2 per message, unless the specific 
context (e.g., festive greeting) strongly justifies more. General guidance 
suggests no more than three per social media post, which can be adapted 
here.17 
○ RULE: Consistently place emojis at the end of sentences or phrases. This is 
crucial for accessibility, as it prevents screen readers from being disrupted 
mid-sentence.17 
○ RULE: Avoid using emojis as substitutes for critical information or as bullet 
points.17 
● Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact): 
○ The inclusion of emojis has been shown to increase open rates and 
engagement with digital communications.19 
○ They are powerful tools for conveying emotion and tone, aspects of 
communication that are often lost in purely text-based interactions.1 
○ Appropriate emoji use can make a brand seem more relatable, human, and 
approachable.19 
● Risks and Considerations for LLM: 
○ Misinterpretation: This is a significant risk. Emojis can be ambiguous, and 
their meanings can vary widely across different cultures, age groups, and 
even individual interpretations.21 An emoji intended to be playful could be 
perceived as unprofessional or confusing. 
○ Accessibility: Overuse of emojis, or using them in ways that interfere with the 
textual content, can create significant barriers for users relying on screen 
readers or those with visual impairments.17 Screen readers announce emojis, 
and a string of them can be highly disruptive. 
○ Professionalism and Brand Voice: The appropriateness of emojis is highly 
dependent on the industry and brand voice. What works for a trendy retail 
brand might be entirely unsuitable for a financial institution or healthcare 
provider.20 The LLM must be calibrated to the specific brand's guidelines on 
formality. 
○ WhatsApp Policy Compliance: While emojis themselves are not "formatting" 
in the syntactical sense, they form part of the message content, which is 
subject to WhatsApp's review and policies. Inappropriate or misleading emoji 
use could contribute to a message being flagged. 
The LLM's formatting choices, particularly with elements like emojis or even the 
density of bolding, can subtly influence the perceived formality of the communication 
channel. While WhatsApp is inherently more conversational than email, B2C messages 
must still maintain a level of professionalism appropriate to the brand and the context 
of the interaction.5 The LLM needs to be programmed to adapt its formatting style to 
match the message's intent and the established brand voice, avoiding extremes of 
either excessive casualness or undue stiffness. For instance, an urgent security alert 
should employ clear, direct formatting (e.g., bold for critical information) with minimal 
or no emojis. Conversely, a promotional message for a lifestyle brand might 
appropriately leverage more expressive emoji use to convey excitement. This 
balancing act is crucial for a positive customer experience. 
J. Crafting High-Impact Calls to Action (CTAs) with Formatting 
The primary objective of many B2C WhatsApp messages is to drive a specific action. 
Formatting plays a pivotal role in ensuring that CTAs are not just present, but are 
unmissable and compelling. 
● Principle: CTAs must be visually distinct and clearly communicate the desired 
action. 
● Strategies: 
○ Bold: This is the most common and often most effective method. Make the 
core action verb or the entire CTA phrase bold to ensure it stands out: "Shop 
Now!", "Tap Here to Track Your Order", "View our Latest Deals".11 
○ Italics (Subtle Emphasis for Benefits): Can be used to highlight a benefit or 
unique selling proposition directly associated with the CTA: "Sign up today for 
exclusive early access." 
○ Emojis (Strategic Placement): A single, relevant emoji placed immediately 
before or after the CTA text can act as a visual cue, drawing the eye: "Explore 
Collection 
➡
 ", "
 📞
 Call Us". This should be used sparingly and with culturally 
neutral emojis.12 
○ Monospace (for Codes within CTAs): If the CTA involves using a specific 
code, formatting the code in monospace enhances clarity: "Redeem your 
discount! Use code WELCOME15 at checkout." 
○ Clarity and Brevity in CTA Text: Formatting enhances a well-written CTA; it 
cannot salvage a vague or confusing one. The CTA text itself should be short, 
direct, and action-oriented.3 
● LLM Logic: 
○ Prioritize bold formatting for all primary textual CTAs. 
○ If emojis are used with CTAs, ensure they are contextually relevant and do not 
clutter the message. 
○ The LLM should ensure that the CTA is clearly delineated from surrounding 
informational text, possibly by placing it on a new line or with clear spacing. 
To effectively guide the LLM, the following table summarizes the strategic application 
of each formatting type in B2C WhatsApp messages, incorporating the "when, how, 
and why."

IV. B2C WhatsApp Communication: Core Principles for Formatted 
Messages 
Beyond the specific rules for each formatting type, several overarching principles 
must guide the LLM's approach to formatting B2C WhatsApp messages. These 
principles ensure that formatting serves its ultimate purpose: to enhance 
communication effectiveness. 
A. Clarity and Conciseness Above All 
The foremost principle is that messages must be effortlessly understandable at a 
single glance.1 All formatting choices should support this goal, never detract from it. 
This means avoiding overly complex formatting combinations that might confuse the 
reader. The language used should be simple and direct, steering clear of jargon or 
overly technical terms unless the target audience is specifically receptive to such 
language.7 
WhatsApp is a medium for brief, direct communication; it is not suited for lengthy 
expositions.1 The LLM should be programmed with a preference for brevity. If a 
message inherently contains a significant amount of information, the LLM must use 
formatting techniques such as bulleted or numbered lists, bold headings, and 
well-placed paragraph breaks to segment the content and maintain scannability. This 
"clarity and conciseness" principle should function as a meta-rule for the LLM. If a 
potential formatting choice, no matter how technically correct or stylistically 
interesting, compromises the immediate clarity of the message or makes it feel 
unnecessarily long or convoluted, that formatting choice should be reconsidered or 
avoided. The LLM's role is to enhance communication, not merely to apply formatting. 
B. Maintaining a Professional and Appropriate Tone 
Even when employing formatting and emojis to make messages more engaging, the 
overall tone must remain professional and align with the established brand identity 
and the specific context of the B2C interaction.5 Overly casual language, slang, or an 
excessive number of playful emojis can undermine credibility, especially in more 
formal B2C relationships or sensitive communications (e.g., financial updates, issue 
resolution). The LLM should generally avoid such elements unless they are a 
deliberate, tested, and approved component of the brand's voice for a particular 
audience segment.5 The LLM's formatting decisions should not inadvertently cause a 
serious message (like a service outage notification) to appear flippant, nor should a 
promotional message come across as overly aggressive or demanding due to 
excessive use of bolding or capitalization (which is not a standard WhatsApp format 
but a common textual emphasis). 
C. Personalization and Relevance 
Effective B2C communication is personalized and relevant to the recipient.2 Formatting 
can play a role in highlighting these personalized elements, making them more 
prominent and reinforcing the sense that the message is tailored to the individual. For 
instance, a customer's name or a specific order number can be bolded: "Hi 
*{{customer_name}}*, your recent order *{{order_id}}* is confirmed." The LLM should 
be capable of identifying placeholders for dynamic content (often denoted by double 
curly braces, e.g., {{1}} as seen in 12) and applying appropriate formatting to these 
variables if it enhances clarity or personalization. 
However, the intersection of personalization and formatting is a high-impact area 
where precision is paramount. An incorrectly formatted personalized field (e.g., 
*{{customer_name with a missing closing asterisk) can be more detrimental than no 
formatting at all, as it looks like a technical error and reflects poorly on the brand's 
attention to detail. Therefore, the LLM must possess exceptionally robust logic for 
handling variables within formatted text segments, ensuring that the syntax for 
formatting around these dynamic elements is implemented flawlessly. Rigorous testing 
of these scenarios is critical to prevent such errors, which can be particularly jarring 
to the customer and damage the perception of competence. The content itself must 
always provide value to the user; formatting alone cannot compensate for irrelevant 
information.2 
D. Ensuring Readability and Scannability 
Given that WhatsApp messages are predominantly consumed on mobile devices, 
often in brief moments, readability and scannability are paramount.1 Formatting tools 
like lists, bolding for keywords or headers, and strategic spacing are essential for 
making messages easy to scan and digest. Beyond character-level formatting, the use 
of adequate white space, primarily through paragraph breaks (newlines), is crucial for 
visual separation and improved comprehension. The LLM should be programmed to 
insert paragraph breaks strategically, especially when a message conveys multiple 
distinct pieces of information or transitions between topics. However, it must also 
adhere to WhatsApp's policies regarding newlines, such as the restriction against 
more than two consecutive newline characters (\n) in message templates, to avoid 
rejection.26 
E. Consistency in Formatting Style 
Developing and maintaining a consistent approach to formatting across various types 
of B2C messages helps in building brand recognition and setting clear customer 
expectations.2 If customers become accustomed to seeing order confirmations 
formatted in a particular way, or CTAs always highlighted with bold text, they can 
process these messages more efficiently. The LLM should be guided by a set of 
internal style rules that promote this consistency. For example, a rule might state that 
all primary CTAs are to be bolded, or that lists of product benefits should always use 
bullet points. This predictability contributes to a smoother and more professional 
customer experience. 
V. Navigating Pitfalls: Common Formatting Mistakes and How to 
Avoid Them (for the LLM) 
To achieve expert-level formatting, the LLM must not only know what to do but also 
what not to do. Avoiding common formatting pitfalls is crucial for maintaining message 
clarity, ensuring deliverability, and preserving a positive brand perception. 
A. Overuse or Inconsistent Use of Formatting 
● The Problem: Applying too much bolding, an excessive number of italics, or a 
barrage of emojis can render messages cluttered, visually overwhelming, and 
unprofessional. This "shouting" effect can also dilute the impact of elements that 
genuinely require emphasis, as readers become desensitized to the highlighting.3 
Inconsistent formatting, where similar types of information are formatted 
differently across messages (e.g., some CTAs bolded, some italicized, some 
plain), can confuse users and make the brand appear disorganized. 
● LLM Avoidance Strategy: 
○ Implement strict moderation rules: e.g., a maximum percentage of words in a 
message that can be bolded (unless it's a list of distinct items or headings), a 
limit on the number of consecutive emojis, or a cap on the total number of 
emojis per message. 
○ Enforce consistency through predefined style guides: For instance, all primary 
CTAs must be bolded; all product names mentioned in passing are italicized; 
all discount codes are in monospace. This ensures a predictable and 
professional appearance. 
B. Formatting That Impedes Readability or Accessibility 
● The Problem: 
○ Emoji Overuse and Misplacement: Long strings of emojis, or using emojis as 
bullet points, can be highly disruptive for users relying on screen readers, as 
each emoji is typically announced. This can make the message tedious and 
difficult to comprehend.17 Emojis should not replace crucial textual 
information. 
○ Lack of Visual Contrast: While not directly controllable by WhatsApp's text 
formatting options (which don't include color changes), the LLM should be 
mindful of creating overly dense text blocks that are hard to read, even if 
individual elements are formatted. 
○ Complex Formatting Combinations: Using multiple formatting styles (e.g., 
bold, italics, and inline code) on a single short phrase can be visually jarring 
and reduce clarity. 
● LLM Avoidance Strategy: 
○ Adhere to strict rules for emoji usage: Limit quantity per message and 
consistently place emojis at the end of a sentence or phrase to minimize 
disruption for screen reader users.17 
○ Prioritize simplicity in formatting: If a combination of formatting styles makes 
the text look cluttered or confusing, the LLM should opt for a simpler, clearer 
alternative. The primary goal is effective communication, not showcasing 
formatting capabilities. 
○ Ensure that essential information is always conveyed through text, with emojis 
serving only as an enhancement, not a replacement. 
C. Syntactical Errors Leading to Formatting Failure or Unintended Output 
● The Problem: Minor syntactical errors can cause formatting to fail entirely, 
leaving the special characters visible as plain text, or can lead to unintended 
formatting that garbles the message. Common errors include forgetting closing 
characters (e.g., *text instead of *text*), using incorrect characters for a specific 
format (e.g., using a hyphen - for italics instead of an underscore _ 12), or having 
incorrect spacing around formatting markers (e.g., no space after a list marker like 
*item instead of * item). 
● LLM Avoidance Strategy: 
○ The LLM must be rigorously trained on the precise syntax for every WhatsApp 
formatting type, including the correct placement of special characters and 
any requirements for surrounding spaces (e.g., after bullet or number list 
markers 10). 
○ Implement robust validation checks, either within the LLM's generation 
process or as a post-processing step, to catch common syntax errors before 
the message is sent. 
○ The LLM should also be aware that different WhatsApp versions or operating 
systems might occasionally render formatting slightly differently, although 
adherence to standard syntax is the best defense against such 
inconsistencies.12 The scale of LLM operations means that even a minor, 
systematic formatting error in its logic could affect thousands of customer 
communications, making rigorous testing and validation paramount. 
D. Formatting Choices that Violate WhatsApp Policies or Lead to Template 
Rejection 
● The Problem: This is arguably the most critical pitfall for automated systems. 
WhatsApp enforces strict guidelines for message templates, particularly 
concerning their content and formatting. Violations can lead to immediate 
template rejection, preventing messages from being sent, and can even result in 
penalties against the business's WhatsApp account, such as reduced sending 
limits or a flagged status.27 Common formatting-related rejection reasons include: 
○ Incorrect syntax for placeholders (variables), e.g., using {1} instead of the 
correct {{1}}.28 
○ Using special characters (like #, $, %) within placeholder definitions. 
○ Non-sequential placeholders, e.g., {{1}}, {{3}} without {{2}}.26 
○ Placeholders appearing at the very beginning or very end of the message 
body.26 
○ Using more than two consecutive newline characters (\n).26 
○ Applying formatting markup (bold, italics), asterisks, or emojis within Text 
Headers of templates.26 
○ Including more than four consecutive spaces within template content.26 
● LLM Avoidance Strategy: 
○ Adherence to WhatsApp's technical template formatting guidelines must be a 
non-negotiable, top-priority constraint system hard-coded into the LLM's 
logic. These rules supersede any stylistic formatting preferences. 
○ The LLM must be explicitly programmed with all known template restrictions.26 
This includes correct placeholder syntax, sequential ordering, and restrictions 
on their placement. 
○ Specific rules must prevent the LLM from attempting to use formatting in 
template headers or from violating newline and spacing limits. 
○ The LLM's ability to format "expertly" is rendered useless if the messages are 
not deliverable. Therefore, compliance with platform rules is paramount. 
E. Misinterpretation of Emojis 
● The Problem: As discussed earlier, emojis are highly contextual and can be 
interpreted differently across cultures, generations, or even based on individual 
mood.21 An emoji intended as friendly (e.g., a winking face 
�
�
 ) could be perceived 
as flirtatious or unprofessional in a B2C context. 
● LLM Avoidance Strategy: 
○ Utilize a predefined "safe list" of emojis that have broadly universal and 
positive or neutral connotations for B2C communication. 
○ Prioritize emojis that enhance clarity (e.g., a clock emoji 
⏰
 for a reminder) or 
convey simple positive emotion (e.g., a smile 
�
�
 for a greeting) without 
significant risk of ambiguity. 
○ The LLM should be programmed to avoid emojis with known dual meanings or 
those that could be perceived as unprofessional or inappropriate for the 
specific industry or message type (e.g., financial advice messages should 
likely avoid most emojis, whereas a fashion retail promotion might use them 
more liberally).20 
F. Creating "Chaotic" Messages 
● The Problem: Even if individual formatting elements are technically correct, a 
message can still be ineffective if its overall structure is poor, leading to a 
"chaotic" or difficult-to-follow experience for the user. This relates to the logical 
f
 low of information and the overall message design, not just isolated formatting 
choices.6 
● LLM Avoidance Strategy: 
○ The LLM should focus on creating a logical flow of information within the 
message. 
○ Formatting should be used to support and enhance this structure (e.g., using 
lists for related items, paragraph breaks to separate distinct ideas), rather 
than being applied merely for decorative purposes. 
○ Ensure a clear hierarchy of information, with the most important points made 
prominent through appropriate formatting. 
To proactively address these potential issues, the following table outlines common 
pitfalls and suggests mitigation strategies for the LLM:

VI. LLM Implementation: Training for Formatting Excellence 
Translating these guidelines into an LLM that consistently produces expertly 
formatted WhatsApp messages requires a multifaceted approach, combining 
rule-based constraints with sophisticated learning techniques. The goal is an LLM that 
not only adheres to syntax and platform policies but also demonstrates a nuanced 
understanding of B2C communication strategy. 
A. Translating Guidelines into LLM Instructions 
A hybrid strategy is likely the most effective path to achieving "expert" status for the 
LLM. Purely rule-based systems might prove too rigid to handle the diverse and 
nuanced nature of B2C dialogue, while purely learning-based systems, if not 
adequately constrained, could inadvertently violate strict WhatsApp template policies 
or develop undesirable formatting habits. 
1. Rule-Based Approaches: These are essential for non-negotiable aspects. 
○ Syntax Adherence: Hard-code the correct syntax for all WhatsApp 
formatting types (e.g., *text* for bold, _text_ for italics). This forms the LLM's 
foundational formatting capability. 
○ WhatsApp Policy Compliance: Implement strict, unalterable rules for all 
WhatsApp template guidelines. This includes correct placeholder usage 
({{1}}), sequential ordering of placeholders, restrictions on placeholder 
placement (not at the beginning or end of the body), limitations on newlines 
and consecutive spaces, and the prohibition of formatting in text headers.26 
These rules act as a critical filter or governor on the LLM's output. 
2. Example-Based Learning (Few-Shot/Many-Shot Prompts): 
○ Provide the LLM with numerous, high-quality examples of "good" and "bad" 
formatted B2C messages across various scenarios (e.g., welcome messages, 
order confirmations, promotional offers, support interactions). 
○ These examples should be annotated to explain why a particular formatting 
choice is good or bad in that context, linking back to the principles of clarity, 
emphasis, tone, and CTA effectiveness. For instance, a "good" example might 
show a well-placed bold CTA, while a "bad" example might show overuse of 
bolding that makes the message hard to read. 
3. Fine-Tuning (If Applicable): 
○ If a general-purpose base LLM is being used, fine-tuning it on a curated 
dataset of expertly formatted WhatsApp B2C messages is highly 
recommended. This dataset should be rich in variety and meticulously crafted 
to reflect all the principles and best practices outlined in this guideline. 
○ The fine-tuning process helps the LLM internalize the patterns and nuances 
of effective formatting within the specific domain of WhatsApp B2C 
communication. 
4. Instructional Prompts: 
○ Develop detailed and context-aware prompts to guide the LLM's formatting 
choices for any given raw message content. These prompts should ideally 
include: 
■ The raw text of the message. 
■ The message's objective (e.g., drive a sale, provide information, resolve an 
issue). 
■ The intended tone (e.g., urgent, friendly, formal, empathetic). 
■ Key information to emphasize (e.g., order number, discount, deadline). 
■ Any specific constraints or brand voice considerations. 
○ Example prompt structure: "Format the following shipping update for 
WhatsApp. Emphasize the tracking number and the estimated delivery date 
using bold. Maintain a helpful and reassuring tone. Raw message: Your 
package with tracking XZY123 will arrive by June 15th." 
B. Key Considerations for the AI Developer 
● Contextual Understanding: The LLM's ability to make "expert" formatting 
choices hinges on its capacity to understand the context of the message. This 
may involve analyzing the message content itself, associated metadata (e.g., 
message type, campaign ID), customer segment information, or even previous 
interaction history. The deeper its contextual understanding, the more 
appropriate its formatting decisions will be. 
● Variable Handling: As highlighted previously, robust and error-free logic for 
formatting text that includes dynamic variables (placeholders like {{1}} or 
{{customer_name}}) is absolutely crucial. The LLM must correctly place formatting 
characters around these variables without breaking the syntax or causing the 
variable itself to be misinterpreted. For example, *{{order_id}}* is correct, while 
*{{order_id*}} or {{*order_id*}} might fail. 
● Prioritization of Rules: A clear hierarchy of rules must be established within the 
LLM's logic. 
1. WhatsApp Policy Rules: These are paramount and non-negotiable. 
Violations lead to message rejection. 
2. Clarity and Readability Rules: Formatting should always enhance, never 
detract from, the ease of understanding. 
3. Stylistic and Emphasis Rules: Choices about bolding, italics, emojis, etc., for 
emphasis or tone are subordinate to policy and clarity. 
● Iterative Refinement: Formatting is a nuanced aspect of communication. The 
LLM's initial performance will likely require ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and 
refinement based on the quality of its output, feedback from human reviewers, 
and potentially A/B testing results. 
C. Testing and Iteration Strategies for LLM Formatting Output 
Achieving "perfect" and "expert" formatting is an iterative process. The testing phase 
is not merely about identifying and fixing bugs but about refining the LLM's 
"judgment" and its ability to make qualitatively sound formatting decisions that align 
with B2C communication best practices. 
● Syntax Validation: Implement automated checks to ensure that all formatting 
applied by the LLM adheres to the correct WhatsApp syntax (e.g., matching 
asterisks for bold, correct list initiation). 
● Visual Review: Conduct thorough human reviews of a diverse set of 
LLM-formatted messages. This review should be done across different devices 
(iOS, Android) and WhatsApp clients (mobile, web, desktop) to check for 
consistent and correct rendering. 
● A/B Testing (Optional but Highly Recommended): For key message types, 
especially those with CTAs or critical information, consider A/B testing different 
formatting approaches generated by the LLM.2 For example, test a CTA in bold 
versus a CTA in bold with a guiding emoji to see which version yields better 
click-through rates or desired actions. This data can then be used to further 
refine the LLM's formatting strategies. 
● Compliance Checks: Before deploying any message templates formatted by the 
LLM, rigorously test them against WhatsApp's validation criteria to ensure they 
will not be rejected. This might involve using sandbox environments or specific 
testing tools provided by WhatsApp Business API providers. 
● Qualitative Assessment: Human evaluators should assess messages not just for 
technical correctness but also against criteria such as: "Does this formatting 
enhance the message's primary goal?", "Does the formatting align with our brand 
voice and the intended tone?", "Is the formatting clear and easy to understand, or 
does it feel cluttered?". This qualitative feedback is vital for calibrating the LLM's 
more subtle decision-making processes. 
D. Maintaining the Formatting Logic 
The digital communication landscape is not static. WhatsApp may introduce new 
formatting features, update its existing ones, or modify its policies regarding message 
templates and content. Therefore, the LLM's formatting logic cannot be a "set it and 
forget it" system. A plan for ongoing maintenance and updates is essential to ensure 
continued compliance and effectiveness. This includes monitoring WhatsApp's official 
developer documentation and community channels for any relevant changes. 
VIII. Appendix: Quick Reference Tables 
For ease of reference during development and ongoing maintenance, the following 
tables consolidate key information. 
Table 1: WhatsApp Formatting Syntax and Basic Usage

(Refer to Section V for the full table content) 
Table 4: WhatsApp Template Formatting Compliance Checklist 
This table provides a focused checklist for the critical area of message template 
compliance, derived from official guidelines and common rejection reasons.26 
Adherence is crucial to prevent message rejection and maintain a healthy sender 
status.

This checklist serves as a critical reference to ensure the LLM's output, particularly for 
pre-approved message templates, meets WhatsApp's stringent requirements, thereby 
mitigating the risk of rejection and supporting operational stability. 
VII. Conclusion: Towards Intelligent and Effective Message 
Formatting 
The strategic application of formatting in B2C WhatsApp communication is a powerful 
lever for enhancing clarity, engagement, and conversion. It transforms simple text into 
a more dynamic and persuasive medium. By systematically implementing the 
guidelines detailed in this report—covering the foundational syntax, the strategic 
"when, how, and why" of each formatting option, core B2C communication principles, 
common pitfalls, and robust LLM training and testing methodologies—it is possible to 
develop an LLM that functions as a true expert in message formatting. 
Such an LLM will be capable of moving beyond rote application of syntax to make 
nuanced, context-aware decisions that elevate the quality and effectiveness of every 
B2C interaction on WhatsApp. This involves not only adhering to the technical 
constraints of the platform, particularly the strict rules for message templates, but 
also understanding the subtle psychological impact of different formatting choices on 
customer perception and behavior. 
The development of this expert formatting capability is an ongoing endeavor. As 
WhatsApp evolves its features and policies, and as customer expectations shift, the 
LLM's programming and training data will require periodic review and refinement. 
Continuous monitoring of message effectiveness, coupled with a commitment to 
adapting the LLM's logic, will ensure that it remains a valuable asset in crafting B2C 
communications that are consistently clear, engaging, professional, and ultimately, 
successful in achieving business objectives. The journey towards intelligent message 
formatting is one of continuous improvement, aimed at maximizing the potential of 
WhatsApp as a vital channel for customer connection.
