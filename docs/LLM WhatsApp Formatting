Mastering WhatsApp Message Formatting: A Developer's Guide to Training an Expert LLM for B2C Communication
I. Introduction: Equipping Your LLM for Expert WhatsApp Formatting
A. The Strategic Imperative of Formatting in B2C WhatsApp Communication

In the dynamic and personal realm of Business-to-Consumer (B2C) WhatsApp communication, the visual presentation of a message carries significant weight, often equaling the importance of its content. Message formatting transcends mere decoration; it serves as an indispensable instrument for enhancing clarity, boosting engagement, and compelling action within these interactions. Properly formatted messages not only improve readability but also project an image of professionalism, which can substantially influence customer perception and elevate response rates. The immediate nature of WhatsApp means users often scan messages quickly; effective formatting ensures that key information is absorbed efficiently and that the overall communication experience is positive.   

The way a brand communicates through this channel, including its attention to formatting detail, directly shapes how it is perceived. Inconsistent, sloppy, or poorly considered formatting, even if the underlying message content is sound, can inadvertently portray a brand as unprofessional or careless. This can erode customer trust and diminish the perceived value of the communication. In essence, the LLM responsible for formatting these messages acts as a digital brand ambassador. Its ability to format "perfectly" is therefore not just a technical achievement but a crucial component of maintaining and enhancing brand equity. Every formatted message is a touchpoint that contributes to the cumulative customer experience.   

B. Defining "Expert Formatting" for an LLM

Achieving "expert formatting" for a Large Language Model (LLM) extends far beyond the mere application of syntactical rules. An expert LLM must grasp the subtleties inherent in B2C communication, comprehending the context, the intended emotional resonance, and the precise objective of each message dispatched. It is not sufficient for the LLM to know how to bold text; it must discern when bolding is the most effective choice to achieve a specific communicative goal and why that choice is superior to others, or to no formatting at all.   

This advanced capability requires the LLM to make nuanced judgments, mirroring the decision-making processes of a human communication expert. For example, an LLM demonstrating "perfect" formatting would understand that while bold text can emphasize a call to action, overusing it throughout a message diminishes its impact and can make the message appear aggressive or difficult to read. This implies a need for the LLM to not only apply formatting rules but also to, in a sense, evaluate the potential effectiveness of its output based on established B2C communication principles. The development process, therefore, should ideally incorporate mechanisms for the LLM to learn from feedback or to score its formatting choices against qualitative benchmarks during its training phase, moving beyond simple syntactical correctness.

C. Purpose and Scope of This Guideline

This document is designed to furnish the AI developer with the essential knowledge, precise rules, and underlying justifications required to train an LLM to attain this sophisticated level of formatting expertise specifically for B2C WhatsApp messages. The scope encompasses all native WhatsApp formatting options, their strategic deployment in various B2C scenarios (including promotional messages, transactional updates, and customer service interactions), best practices for maximizing clarity and engagement, common pitfalls that can lead to miscommunication or message rejection, and the rationale underpinning optimal formatting decisions.

D. How to Use This Guideline for LLM Development

The principles, rules, and illustrative examples detailed within this guideline are intended to be directly translatable into practical strategies for LLM development. This includes their use in constructing comprehensive training datasets, formulating explicit rule-sets to govern formatting logic, and potentially guiding fine-tuning processes for pre-trained LLMs. The aim is to provide a clear pathway for embedding deep formatting intelligence into the LLM, enabling it to autonomously produce messages that are not only correctly formatted but also strategically effective.

II. Foundations: WhatsApp's Native Formatting Capabilities
A. Overview of Available Formatting Options

WhatsApp provides a core suite of text formatting tools that serve as the fundamental building blocks for creating messages that are clear, structured, and visually engaging. These native options include: Bold, Italics, Strikethrough, Monospace, Bulleted Lists, Numbered Lists, Block Quotes, and Inline Code. It is important to note that WhatsApp does not offer an option to disable these formatting features; any text entered using the correct syntax will be formatted accordingly. This inherent characteristic underscores the platform's design towards encouraging formatted communication. The easy availability of these tools to human users, often via simple shortcuts, suggests an expectation that messages, including B2C communications, will leverage formatting for improved clarity and impact. Consequently, an LLM producing unformatted or poorly formatted messages would likely be perceived as less professional or sophisticated compared to human-generated communications.   

B. Detailed Breakdown of Each Formatting Option

A thorough understanding of each formatting option's syntax and primary function is essential for programming the LLM.

Bold:

Syntax: Place an asterisk on both sides of the text: *text*.   
Visual Example: Raw: *Important Update* Rendered: Important Update
Primary Function: To emphasize key words or phrases, making them stand out.
Alternative Application Methods: On mobile devices, users can often tap and hold text to access a formatting menu that includes Bold. (This is for contextual understanding of user behavior, not direct LLM implementation).   
Italic:

Syntax: Place an underscore on both sides of the text: _text_.   
Visual Example: Raw: _New Collection_ Rendered: New Collection
Primary Function: To provide subtle emphasis, often used for titles, foreign words, or to convey a specific tone.
Alternative Application Methods: Similar to Bold, tap-and-hold shortcuts are often available.   
Strikethrough:

Syntax: Place a tilde on both sides of the text: ~text~.   
Visual Example: Raw: ~Was $50~ Rendered: ~Was $50~
Primary Function: To show corrections, deletions, or that certain information is no longer valid (e.g., an old price).
Monospace:

Syntax: Place three backticks on both sides of the text: .   
Visual Example: Raw: CODE123 Rendered: CODE123
Primary Function: To display text in a fixed-width font, typically used for code snippets, technical terms, or pre-formatted text.
Bulleted List:

Syntax: Place an asterisk or hyphen and a space before each list item: * item or - item.   
Visual Example: Raw: * Feature 1 * Feature 2 Rendered:
Feature 1
Feature 2
Primary Function: To present a list of items where the order is not critical.
Numbered List:

Syntax: Place a number, a period, and a space before each list item: 1. item.   
Visual Example: Raw: 1. Step one 2. Step two Rendered:
Step one
Step two
Primary Function: To present a list of items where the order or sequence is important, such as instructions.
Block Quote:

Syntax: Place an angle bracket and a space before the text: > text.   
Visual Example: Raw: > This is a customer testimonial. Rendered:
This is a customer testimonial.

Primary Function: To set apart quoted text, testimonials, or important notices.
Inline Code:

Syntax: Place a single backtick on both sides of the text: `text`.   
Visual Example: Raw: Use the `submit` button. Rendered: Use the submit button.
Primary Function: To highlight short pieces of code, commands, or specific technical terms within a sentence.
The fact that these formatting features are always active and cannot be disabled  presents a critical consideration for the LLM. It must be acutely aware that characters like *, _, ~, and ` will trigger formatting if used in the prescribed way. Therefore, the LLM needs explicit rules for situations where these characters are intended to be displayed literally as part of the message content (e.g., in product names like "Wonder_Widget", mathematical notations, or specific branding). This necessitates instructions on how to escape these characters, for instance, by using a backslash (\) before the special character, as indicated in some developer resources , to prevent unintended formatting and ensure message integrity. Failure to manage this can lead to corrupted messages, significantly undermining clarity and professionalism.   

C. Combining Formatting

WhatsApp allows for the combination of certain formatting styles, such as applying both bold and italics to a piece of text (e.g., *_important note_* would render as important note). However, it's important for the LLM to understand that the monospace format typically overrides other formatting styles applied to the same text. If text is marked for monospace, any bold or italic formatting within that same segment will likely be ignored, and the text will render solely in monospace, potentially showing the formatting characters (like asterisks) literally. This is a key detail for the LLM to avoid generating messages with unexpected visual outputs.   

To consolidate this foundational knowledge, the following table outlines the syntax and primary purpose of each formatting option:

Table 1: WhatsApp Formatting Syntax and Basic Usage

Formatting Type	Syntax (How to Apply)	Visual Example (Raw → Rendered)	Primary Function/Purpose
Bold	*text*	*Alert* → Alert	Emphasis, highlighting key information, CTAs, headlines
Italic	_text_	_Product Name_ → Product Name	Subtle emphasis, titles, foreign words, specific terminology
Strikethrough	~text~	~Old Price~ → ~Old Price~	Showing corrections, deletions, outdated information
Monospace		CODE789 → CODE789	Displaying codes, technical data, pre-formatted text
Bulleted List	* text (or - text)	* Item A <br> * Item B → <br> • Item A <br> • Item B	Listing unordered items, features, options
Numbered List	1. text	1. First <br> 2. Second → <br> 1. First <br> 2. Second	Listing ordered items, steps, instructions, rankings
Block Quote	> text	> Important Notice → <br> > Important Notice	Highlighting quotes, testimonials, significant notes
Inline Code	`text`	`command` → command	Highlighting short code snippets or technical terms in a line

This table serves as a fundamental reference for the LLM, detailing the mechanics of applying each format. The "Syntax" column provides the "how," the "Visual Example" offers clear input/output pairs crucial for training and validation, and the "Primary Function" introduces a basic semantic understanding. This forms the initial layer of the LLM's knowledge base regarding WhatsApp formatting.

III. Strategic Formatting for B2C Message Excellence: The "When, How, and Why"
This section delves into the expert application of each formatting option, providing the LLM with the nuanced understanding required to make contextually appropriate and effective formatting decisions in B2C communication. The effectiveness of these formatting choices often connects to fundamental psychological principles of visual processing, where elements like bold text are perceived as more important or urgent , and italics can subtly influence recall or perceived sophistication. An LLM that implicitly understands these underpinnings will be better equipped to make optimal choices that go beyond simple pattern matching, truly enhancing the communication's impact. However, a key principle is moderation; overuse of any emphasis technique can diminish its effect and make messages appear cluttered or unprofessional. The LLM must learn this balance.   

A. Bold (*text*)

When to Use (Context & Triggers):

Highlighting Key Information: Essential for drawing immediate attention to critical details such as order numbers, shipping statuses (e.g., "Your order has been shipped"), important alerts, or deadlines.   
Emphasizing Calls to Action (CTAs): Crucial for making CTAs like "Shop Now", "Learn More", or "Contact Support" prominent and actionable.   
Drawing Attention to Promotions/Offers: Effective for highlighting special deals, discounts, or limited-time offers, such as "Limited Time Offer!" or "Get 20% OFF".   
Creating Headlines/Subheadings: Useful for structuring longer messages, improving scannability by breaking text into logical sections with clear headers.   
Brand Names or Product Names: Can be used for instant recognition, especially when introducing a brand or product within a message (e.g., "Welcome to Gallabox").   
How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples):

IF message_segment_is_primary_cta THEN apply_bold(cta_phrase). Example: Input "Click here to track your order" -> Output "Click here to track your order" or "Click here to track your order".
IF entity_type IS 'discount_value' OR entity_type IS 'offer_keyword' (e.g., "Sale", "Free") THEN apply_bold(entity_text). Example: "Get 20% off this week" -> "Get 20% off this week".
IF information_type IS 'order_confirmation_number' OR information_type IS 'tracking_id_label' THEN apply_bold(information_text). Example: "Your order number is ORD12345" -> "Your order number is ORD12345".
IF text_is_intended_as_section_header THEN apply_bold(header_text).
Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact):

Bold text has a strong visual weight that immediately captures the reader's attention, significantly increasing the probability that the emphasized information will be noticed and processed, especially in the fast-paced environment of WhatsApp.   
From a psychological perspective, bold typography is associated with strength, importance, and authority. This makes the bolded content appear more significant and can lend urgency or weight to CTAs and critical alerts.   
It greatly improves the scannability of messages, allowing users to quickly identify the most salient points without reading every word.   
B. Italics (_text_)

When to Use (Context & Triggers):

Subtle Emphasis: Ideal for highlighting a word or phrase when a less forceful emphasis than bold is desired. For instance, "We are very excited to announce...".   
Product Names/Titles: Commonly used for names of books, films, specific software features, or distinct service packages (e.g., "Check out our Summer Collection").   
Foreign Words/Phrases: Appropriate for setting apart non-native words or phrases used within a sentence (e.g., "Our new dessert is a panna cotta.").   
Defining Terms or Introducing New Concepts: Useful when introducing a specific term or feature name for the first time, e.g., "Our platform now includes SmartAnalytics."
Adding a Touch of Sophistication or Nuance: Can be employed to subtly alter the tone, making it feel more refined or to emphasize a particular quality.
How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples):

IF emphasis_requirement IS 'subtle' AND text_segment IS target_for_emphasis THEN apply_italics(text_segment).
IF entity_type IS 'book_title' OR entity_type IS 'product_name_within_sentence' OR entity_type IS 'foreign_term' THEN apply_italics(entity_text). Example: "Read our guide on Advanced Gardening Techniques."
Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact):

Italics offer a softer visual cue compared to bold, making them suitable for conveying nuance or gentle emphasis without disrupting the flow of the text as much as bold might.   
This formatting can lend a sense of refinement or call specific attention to terminology. Some research even suggests that italics can be effective for promoting offers  and may influence information recall, although legibility remains a key factor to consider to avoid making text harder to read.   
C. Strikethrough (~text~)

When to Use (Context & Triggers):

Showing Price Reductions: A very common and effective use, clearly indicating a discount: "Special Offer: ~$99~ $69!".   
Indicating Corrections or Updates: Useful for showing that previous information is no longer current: "Event date changed from ~Oct 15~ to Oct 22.".   
Highlighting Sold-Out Items or Limited Availability: Can be used to show items that are no longer available or to create urgency: "Red Scarf: ~Sold Out~. Blue Scarf: Only 3 left!".   
Showing a Change of Opinion or Humorous Retraction: This should be used cautiously in B2C contexts as it can be perceived as unprofessional if not handled well. Example: "We planned for a ~small~ HUGE surprise!"
How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples):

IF message_segment CONTAINS 'original_price_indicator' THEN apply_strikethrough(price_value_associated_with_indicator). Example: "Was $100, Now $75" -> "Was ~$100~, Now $75".
IF message_purpose IS 'update_information' AND text_segment IS 'outdated_information' THEN apply_strikethrough(text_segment).
Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact):

Strikethrough provides an unambiguous visual cue that information has been changed, is no longer valid, or represents a previous state (like an old price), which enhances transparency with the customer.   
In sales contexts, displaying a struck-out original price alongside a new, lower price can effectively highlight the value of a discount and create a sense of urgency.
D. Monospace ()

When to Use (Context & Triggers):

Displaying Codes: Ideal for coupon codes, discount codes, tracking numbers, product SKUs, serial numbers, or any short alphanumeric string that benefits from clear, unambiguous representation (e.g., "Your coupon code is SAVE25NOW").   
Technical Information/Commands: While less frequent in general B2C messages, it's valuable for businesses offering technical products or support where specific commands or parameters need to be conveyed accurately (e.g., "Enter /help for assistance").   
Short, Pre-formatted Text Snippets: Useful when the exact spacing and character representation of a small piece of text is important and should not be altered by proportional fonts.
How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples):

IF entity_type IS 'discount_code' OR entity_type IS 'order_tracking_code' OR entity_type IS 'product_sku' THEN apply_monospace(entity_text). Example: "Use code VIP2024" -> "Use code VIP2024".
Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact):

Monospace font visually isolates technical or code-like text from the surrounding narrative text. This improves readability and significantly reduces the chance of errors if the customer needs to transcribe the code.   
The fixed-width nature of monospace ensures that characters like 'I', 'l', '1' or 'O', '0' are more easily distinguishable, which is crucial for the accuracy of codes and technical data.
E. Bulleted Lists (* text or - text)

When to Use (Context & Triggers):

Listing Features or Benefits: Excellent for presenting multiple product features, service benefits, or advantages in an easy-to-digest format where the order of items is not paramount.   
Short, Scannable Points: When conveying several distinct pieces of information that don't require a specific sequence.
Presenting Options or Choices: Clearly laying out different choices available to the customer.
How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples):

IF message_content_type IS 'list_of_product_features' AND item_order_is_not_significant THEN format_as_bulleted_list(feature_items).
Each item in the list must begin with * (asterisk followed by a space) or - (hyphen followed by a space).
Example: "Our plan includes: Unlimited Data, Free Setup, 24/7 Support" -> "Our plan includes: * Unlimited Data * Free Setup * 24/7 Support"
Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact):

Bulleted lists break up potentially dense blocks of text, making complex information significantly more digestible and scannable, especially on mobile screens.   
They improve comprehension by visually organizing related points, allowing users to quickly grasp the main takeaways.
F. Numbered Lists (1. text)

When to Use (Context & Triggers):

Step-by-Step Instructions: Essential for guiding users through a process, such as how to use a product, complete a setup, or redeem an offer.   
Ranked Items or Prioritized Information: When the sequence or order of items is meaningful (e.g., "Top 3 reasons to upgrade:").
Enumerating a Specific Count of Items: Clearly indicating a set number of points, e.g., "Follow these 4 easy steps:".
How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples):

IF message_content_type IS 'procedural_instructions' OR message_content_type IS 'sequential_steps_guide' THEN format_as_numbered_list(instruction_items).
Each item in the list must begin with N. (a number, followed by a period, followed by a space).
Example: "To reset: Turn off device. Wait 10 seconds. Turn on device." -> "To reset: 1. Turn off device. 2. Wait 10 seconds. 3. Turn on device."
Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact):

Numbered lists are indispensable for clarity when presenting information that has a required sequence or involves following a procedure.   
They logically guide the user through a process, reducing confusion and increasing the likelihood of successful completion of the task.
G. Block Quotes (> text)

When to Use (Context & Triggers):

Highlighting Customer Testimonials: If a brief and impactful testimonial is included in a message, block quotes can give it prominence.   
Emphasizing Important Notices or Disclaimers: Useful for drawing special attention to critical pieces of information, such as policy changes or warnings (e.g., > Please note: Our office will be closed on Monday.).   
Quoting a Previous Message or Statement for Context: While less common in proactive B2C messaging, it can be useful in customer support dialogues to refer back to a user's earlier statement.
How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples):

IF message_segment_category IS 'customer_quote' OR message_segment_category IS 'critical_notice_within_message' THEN format_as_block_quote(segment_text).
The text to be quoted must be preceded by > (angle bracket followed by a space).
Example: "Our customer said: This product is amazing!" -> > Our customer said: This product is amazing!
Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact):

Block quotes visually separate the quoted or emphasized text from the main body of the message, giving it distinct prominence and drawing the reader's eye.   
When used for testimonials, this formatting can enhance credibility and make the endorsement stand out.
H. Inline Code (`text`)

When to Use (Context & Triggers):

Highlighting Short Specific Keywords, Commands, or Technical Terms Within a Sentence: Useful for drawing attention to specific interactive elements like button names, menu options, or brief technical terms without the formality of full monospace (e.g., "Please click the `Confirm` button to continue.").   
Referring to Specific Field Names or Variables: When discussing form fields or data points within a sentence (e.g., "Enter your `UserID` in the field provided.").
How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples):

IF text_segment_is_ui_element_name_in_sentence OR text_segment_is_short_technical_keyword_in_sentence THEN apply_inline_code(text_segment).
Example: "Check the status under My Orders." -> "Check the status under `My Orders`."
Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact):

Inline code provides a subtle yet clear visual distinction for specific terms embedded within a sentence, differentiating them from the narrative text without the more significant visual break of the full three-backtick monospace format.   
It is particularly effective for drawing attention to clickable elements, specific data inputs, or key terms that users need to identify within a larger context.
I. Strategic Use of Emojis in B2C Messages

Emojis, while not a traditional formatting tool, play a significant role in shaping the tone and readability of WhatsApp messages. Their use must be strategic and context-aware.

When to Use (Context & Triggers):

Adding Emotional Tone and Personality: Emojis can make messages feel friendlier, more empathetic, celebratory, or welcoming. For example, a welcome message might include a 😊 or 👋 , while birthday greetings could use 🎉.   
Drawing Attention to Key Points or CTAs (Sparingly): A well-chosen, relevant emoji placed near a CTA can provide a gentle visual nudge (e.g., "View our new arrivals ➡️").   
Replacing Words for Brevity (Use with Extreme Caution): While emojis like 👍 can sometimes replace "okay" or "got it," this should be used very sparingly in B2C to avoid ambiguity.
Visual Break and Engagement: Emojis can make messages more visually appealing and break the monotony of text, potentially increasing engagement.   
How to Implement (LLM Logic - Examples):

IF message_intent IS 'friendly_greeting' AND brand_voice_allows_informality THEN consider_adding_emoji(e.g., 😊, 👋).
IF message_purpose IS 'celebratory_announcement' (e.g., anniversary, milestone) THEN consider_adding_emoji(e.g., 🎉, ✨).
RULE: Limit emoji usage to a maximum of 1-2 per message, unless the specific context (e.g., festive greeting) strongly justifies more. General guidance suggests no more than three per social media post, which can be adapted here.   
RULE: Consistently place emojis at the end of sentences or phrases. This is crucial for accessibility, as it prevents screen readers from being disrupted mid-sentence.   
RULE: Avoid using emojis as substitutes for critical information or as bullet points.   
Why it's Effective (Justification & Impact):

The inclusion of emojis has been shown to increase open rates and engagement with digital communications.   
They are powerful tools for conveying emotion and tone, aspects of communication that are often lost in purely text-based interactions.   
Appropriate emoji use can make a brand seem more relatable, human, and approachable.   
Risks and Considerations for LLM:

Misinterpretation: This is a significant risk. Emojis can be ambiguous, and their meanings can vary widely across different cultures, age groups, and even individual interpretations. An emoji intended to be playful could be perceived as unprofessional or confusing.   
Accessibility: Overuse of emojis, or using them in ways that interfere with the textual content, can create significant barriers for users relying on screen readers or those with visual impairments. Screen readers announce emojis, and a string of them can be highly disruptive.   
Professionalism and Brand Voice: The appropriateness of emojis is highly dependent on the industry and brand voice. What works for a trendy retail brand might be entirely unsuitable for a financial institution or healthcare provider. The LLM must be calibrated to the specific brand's guidelines on formality.   
WhatsApp Policy Compliance: While emojis themselves are not "formatting" in the syntactical sense, they form part of the message content, which is subject to WhatsApp's review and policies. Inappropriate or misleading emoji use could contribute to a message being flagged.
The LLM's formatting choices, particularly with elements like emojis or even the density of bolding, can subtly influence the perceived formality of the communication channel. While WhatsApp is inherently more conversational than email, B2C messages must still maintain a level of professionalism appropriate to the brand and the context of the interaction. The LLM needs to be programmed to adapt its formatting style to match the message's intent and the established brand voice, avoiding extremes of either excessive casualness or undue stiffness. For instance, an urgent security alert should employ clear, direct formatting (e.g., bold for critical information) with minimal or no emojis. Conversely, a promotional message for a lifestyle brand might appropriately leverage more expressive emoji use to convey excitement. This balancing act is crucial for a positive customer experience.   

J. Crafting High-Impact Calls to Action (CTAs) with Formatting

The primary objective of many B2C WhatsApp messages is to drive a specific action. Formatting plays a pivotal role in ensuring that CTAs are not just present, but are unmissable and compelling.

Principle: CTAs must be visually distinct and clearly communicate the desired action.
Strategies:
Bold: This is the most common and often most effective method. Make the core action verb or the entire CTA phrase bold to ensure it stands out: "Shop Now!", "Tap Here to Track Your Order", "View our Latest Deals".   
Italics (Subtle Emphasis for Benefits): Can be used to highlight a benefit or unique selling proposition directly associated with the CTA: "Sign up today for exclusive early access."
Emojis (Strategic Placement): A single, relevant emoji placed immediately before or after the CTA text can act as a visual cue, drawing the eye: "Explore Collection ➡️", "📞 Call Us". This should be used sparingly and with culturally neutral emojis.   
Monospace (for Codes within CTAs): If the CTA involves using a specific code, formatting the code in monospace enhances clarity: "Redeem your discount! Use code WELCOME15 at checkout."
Clarity and Brevity in CTA Text: Formatting enhances a well-written CTA; it cannot salvage a vague or confusing one. The CTA text itself should be short, direct, and action-oriented.   
LLM Logic:
Prioritize bold formatting for all primary textual CTAs.
If emojis are used with CTAs, ensure they are contextually relevant and do not clutter the message.
The LLM should ensure that the CTA is clearly delineated from surrounding informational text, possibly by placing it on a new line or with clear spacing.
To effectively guide the LLM, the following table summarizes the strategic application of each formatting type in B2C WhatsApp messages, incorporating the "when, how, and why."

Table 2: Strategic Application of Formatting in B2C WhatsApp Messages

Formatting Type	B2C Use Case/Objective	LLM Instruction Logic (When & How - with examples)	Justification (Why - linking to impact/psychology)	Good Example (Illustrative B2C message snippet)	Common Pitfall/Bad Example (Illustrative)
Bold	Emphasis, CTAs, Key Info, Headlines	IF text_is_cta OR text_is_critical_alert OR text_is_main_offer THEN apply_bold(text). Ex: "Limited Stock!"	Draws immediate attention, conveys importance/urgency, improves scannability.	"Your order #12345 has been shipped! Track it here: bit.ly/track"	"Everything in this message is bolded, making it hard to know what is truly important and looks like shouting."
Italics	Subtle emphasis, Product/Book Titles, Foreign words	IF text_is_product_name_in_sentence OR emphasis_is_subtle THEN apply_italics(text). Ex: "The Innovator's Dilemma"	Softer highlight, adds nuance, can denote specific terminology or titles.	"We recommend reading The Art of Conversation for more tips."	"This entire paragraph is in italics, which makes it difficult to read quickly and loses any specific emphasis."
~Strikethrough~	Price reductions, Corrections, Sold-out items	IF text_is_original_price OR text_is_corrected_info THEN apply_strikethrough(text). Ex: "~Was $50~"	Clearly shows changes or discounts, transparently indicates outdated info.	"Special offer: ~€29.99~ €19.99 for today only!"	"Our ~amazing~ ~super~ fantastic sale is on ~now~ soon!" (Overuse, confusing)
Monospace	Codes (coupon, tracking), Technical terms	IF text_is_coupon_code OR text_is_technical_identifier THEN apply_monospace(text). Ex: CODE123	Clearly distinguishes technical/code text, improves transcription accuracy.	"Use promo code SUMMER20 at checkout."	"Please read our terms and conditions." (Inappropriate use for regular words)
Bulleted List	Features, Benefits, Unordered options	IF listing_items_without_sequence THEN format_as_bulleted_list(items). Ex: * Point A	Improves readability and scannability for multiple related points, breaks up text.	"Benefits include: <br> * Faster processing <br> * Dedicated support <br> * Exclusive content"	"Features: *Fast. *Reliable. *Easy to use." (Incorrect spacing, looks like a run-on sentence)
Numbered List	Instructions, Steps, Ranked items	IF listing_sequential_steps OR ranked_items THEN format_as_numbered_list(items). Ex: 1. Action one	Essential for clarity in procedures or sequences, guides user logically.	"To apply: <br> 1. Visit our website. <br> 2. Fill the form. <br> 3. Click submit."	"1-Go here. 2-Do this. 3-Then that." (Missing periods and spaces, less readable)
> Block Quote	Testimonials, Important notices	IF text_is_testimonial OR text_is_important_disclaimer THEN format_as_block_quote(text). Ex: > Customer review	Visually sets apart key statements or quotes, adds prominence.	"> Please remember: Submissions close Friday at 5 PM."	"> Every > single > line > is > quoted > making > it > hard > to > read." (Overuse on short, non-distinct lines)
`Inline Code`	Short technical terms in sentence, UI element names	IF text_is_short_code_in_sentence OR text_is_button_name THEN apply_inline_code(text). Ex: `config.sys`	Subtle visual distinction for specific terms within a sentence.	"Navigate to the `Settings` menu and select `Profile`."	"Our `new` `product` is `amazing`!" (Inappropriate for general words, looks cluttered)
Emojis	Add emotion, Visual appeal, Attention (sparingly for CTAs)	IF message_sentiment_is_positive AND brand_voice_allows THEN add_relevant_emoji_at_end. Ex: "Welcome! 😊"	Convey tone, increase engagement, humanize brand. Risks: misinterpretation, unprofessionalism if overused.	"Great news! Your package has arrived 🚚. Enjoy!"	"🔥🔥🔥SALE NOW ON!!! 🤑🤑🤑 BUY BUY BUY 🛍️🛍️🛍️🎉🎉🎉" (Excessive, unprofessional, spammy, accessibility issues)
  
IV. B2C WhatsApp Communication: Core Principles for Formatted Messages
Beyond the specific rules for each formatting type, several overarching principles must guide the LLM's approach to formatting B2C WhatsApp messages. These principles ensure that formatting serves its ultimate purpose: to enhance communication effectiveness.

A. Clarity and Conciseness Above All

The foremost principle is that messages must be effortlessly understandable at a single glance. All formatting choices should support this goal, never detract from it. This means avoiding overly complex formatting combinations that might confuse the reader. The language used should be simple and direct, steering clear of jargon or overly technical terms unless the target audience is specifically receptive to such language.   

WhatsApp is a medium for brief, direct communication; it is not suited for lengthy expositions. The LLM should be programmed with a preference for brevity. If a message inherently contains a significant amount of information, the LLM must use formatting techniques such as bulleted or numbered lists, bold headings, and well-placed paragraph breaks to segment the content and maintain scannability. This "clarity and conciseness" principle should function as a meta-rule for the LLM. If a potential formatting choice, no matter how technically correct or stylistically interesting, compromises the immediate clarity of the message or makes it feel unnecessarily long or convoluted, that formatting choice should be reconsidered or avoided. The LLM's role is to enhance communication, not merely to apply formatting.   

B. Maintaining a Professional and Appropriate Tone

Even when employing formatting and emojis to make messages more engaging, the overall tone must remain professional and align with the established brand identity and the specific context of the B2C interaction. Overly casual language, slang, or an excessive number of playful emojis can undermine credibility, especially in more formal B2C relationships or sensitive communications (e.g., financial updates, issue resolution). The LLM should generally avoid such elements unless they are a deliberate, tested, and approved component of the brand's voice for a particular audience segment. The LLM's formatting decisions should not inadvertently cause a serious message (like a service outage notification) to appear flippant, nor should a promotional message come across as overly aggressive or demanding due to excessive use of bolding or capitalization (which is not a standard WhatsApp format but a common textual emphasis).   

C. Personalization and Relevance

Effective B2C communication is personalized and relevant to the recipient. Formatting can play a role in highlighting these personalized elements, making them more prominent and reinforcing the sense that the message is tailored to the individual. For instance, a customer's name or a specific order number can be bolded: "Hi *{{customer_name}}*, your recent order *{{order_id}}* is confirmed." The LLM should be capable of identifying placeholders for dynamic content (often denoted by double curly braces, e.g., {{1}} as seen in ) and applying appropriate formatting to these variables if it enhances clarity or personalization.   

However, the intersection of personalization and formatting is a high-impact area where precision is paramount. An incorrectly formatted personalized field (e.g., *{{customer_name with a missing closing asterisk) can be more detrimental than no formatting at all, as it looks like a technical error and reflects poorly on the brand's attention to detail. Therefore, the LLM must possess exceptionally robust logic for handling variables within formatted text segments, ensuring that the syntax for formatting around these dynamic elements is implemented flawlessly. Rigorous testing of these scenarios is critical to prevent such errors, which can be particularly jarring to the customer and damage the perception of competence. The content itself must always provide value to the user; formatting alone cannot compensate for irrelevant information.   

D. Ensuring Readability and Scannability

Given that WhatsApp messages are predominantly consumed on mobile devices, often in brief moments, readability and scannability are paramount. Formatting tools like lists, bolding for keywords or headers, and strategic spacing are essential for making messages easy to scan and digest. Beyond character-level formatting, the use of adequate white space, primarily through paragraph breaks (newlines), is crucial for visual separation and improved comprehension. The LLM should be programmed to insert paragraph breaks strategically, especially when a message conveys multiple distinct pieces of information or transitions between topics. However, it must also adhere to WhatsApp's policies regarding newlines, such as the restriction against more than two consecutive newline characters (\n) in message templates, to avoid rejection.   

E. Consistency in Formatting Style

Developing and maintaining a consistent approach to formatting across various types of B2C messages helps in building brand recognition and setting clear customer expectations. If customers become accustomed to seeing order confirmations formatted in a particular way, or CTAs always highlighted with bold text, they can process these messages more efficiently. The LLM should be guided by a set of internal style rules that promote this consistency. For example, a rule might state that all primary CTAs are to be bolded, or that lists of product benefits should always use bullet points. This predictability contributes to a smoother and more professional customer experience.   

V. Navigating Pitfalls: Common Formatting Mistakes and How to Avoid Them (for the LLM)
To achieve expert-level formatting, the LLM must not only know what to do but also what not to do. Avoiding common formatting pitfalls is crucial for maintaining message clarity, ensuring deliverability, and preserving a positive brand perception.

A. Overuse or Inconsistent Use of Formatting

The Problem: Applying too much bolding, an excessive number of italics, or a barrage of emojis can render messages cluttered, visually overwhelming, and unprofessional. This "shouting" effect can also dilute the impact of elements that genuinely require emphasis, as readers become desensitized to the highlighting. Inconsistent formatting, where similar types of information are formatted differently across messages (e.g., some CTAs bolded, some italicized, some plain), can confuse users and make the brand appear disorganized.   
LLM Avoidance Strategy:
Implement strict moderation rules: e.g., a maximum percentage of words in a message that can be bolded (unless it's a list of distinct items or headings), a limit on the number of consecutive emojis, or a cap on the total number of emojis per message.
Enforce consistency through predefined style guides: For instance, all primary CTAs must be bolded; all product names mentioned in passing are italicized; all discount codes are in monospace. This ensures a predictable and professional appearance.
B. Formatting That Impedes Readability or Accessibility

The Problem:
Emoji Overuse and Misplacement: Long strings of emojis, or using emojis as bullet points, can be highly disruptive for users relying on screen readers, as each emoji is typically announced. This can make the message tedious and difficult to comprehend. Emojis should not replace crucial textual information.   
Lack of Visual Contrast: While not directly controllable by WhatsApp's text formatting options (which don't include color changes), the LLM should be mindful of creating overly dense text blocks that are hard to read, even if individual elements are formatted.
Complex Formatting Combinations: Using multiple formatting styles (e.g., bold, italics, and inline code) on a single short phrase can be visually jarring and reduce clarity.
LLM Avoidance Strategy:
Adhere to strict rules for emoji usage: Limit quantity per message and consistently place emojis at the end of a sentence or phrase to minimize disruption for screen reader users.   
Prioritize simplicity in formatting: If a combination of formatting styles makes the text look cluttered or confusing, the LLM should opt for a simpler, clearer alternative. The primary goal is effective communication, not showcasing formatting capabilities.
Ensure that essential information is always conveyed through text, with emojis serving only as an enhancement, not a replacement.
C. Syntactical Errors Leading to Formatting Failure or Unintended Output

The Problem: Minor syntactical errors can cause formatting to fail entirely, leaving the special characters visible as plain text, or can lead to unintended formatting that garbles the message. Common errors include forgetting closing characters (e.g., *text instead of *text*), using incorrect characters for a specific format (e.g., using a hyphen - for italics instead of an underscore _ ), or having incorrect spacing around formatting markers (e.g., no space after a list marker like *item instead of * item).   
LLM Avoidance Strategy:
The LLM must be rigorously trained on the precise syntax for every WhatsApp formatting type, including the correct placement of special characters and any requirements for surrounding spaces (e.g., after bullet or number list markers ).   
Implement robust validation checks, either within the LLM's generation process or as a post-processing step, to catch common syntax errors before the message is sent.
The LLM should also be aware that different WhatsApp versions or operating systems might occasionally render formatting slightly differently, although adherence to standard syntax is the best defense against such inconsistencies. The scale of LLM operations means that even a minor, systematic formatting error in its logic could affect thousands of customer communications, making rigorous testing and validation paramount.   
D. Formatting Choices that Violate WhatsApp Policies or Lead to Template Rejection

The Problem: This is arguably the most critical pitfall for automated systems. WhatsApp enforces strict guidelines for message templates, particularly concerning their content and formatting. Violations can lead to immediate template rejection, preventing messages from being sent, and can even result in penalties against the business's WhatsApp account, such as reduced sending limits or a flagged status. Common formatting-related rejection reasons include:   
Incorrect syntax for placeholders (variables), e.g., using {1} instead of the correct {{1}}.   
Using special characters (like #, $, %) within placeholder definitions.
Non-sequential placeholders, e.g., {{1}}, {{3}} without {{2}}.   
Placeholders appearing at the very beginning or very end of the message body.   
Using more than two consecutive newline characters (\n).   
Applying formatting markup (bold, italics), asterisks, or emojis within Text Headers of templates.   
Including more than four consecutive spaces within template content.   
LLM Avoidance Strategy:
Adherence to WhatsApp's technical template formatting guidelines must be a non-negotiable, top-priority constraint system hard-coded into the LLM's logic. These rules supersede any stylistic formatting preferences.
The LLM must be explicitly programmed with all known template restrictions. This includes correct placeholder syntax, sequential ordering, and restrictions on their placement.   
Specific rules must prevent the LLM from attempting to use formatting in template headers or from violating newline and spacing limits.
The LLM's ability to format "expertly" is rendered useless if the messages are not deliverable. Therefore, compliance with platform rules is paramount.
E. Misinterpretation of Emojis

The Problem: As discussed earlier, emojis are highly contextual and can be interpreted differently across cultures, generations, or even based on individual mood. An emoji intended as friendly (e.g., a winking face 😉) could be perceived as flirtatious or unprofessional in a B2C context.   
LLM Avoidance Strategy:
Utilize a predefined "safe list" of emojis that have broadly universal and positive or neutral connotations for B2C communication.
Prioritize emojis that enhance clarity (e.g., a clock emoji ⏰ for a reminder) or convey simple positive emotion (e.g., a smile 😊 for a greeting) without significant risk of ambiguity.
The LLM should be programmed to avoid emojis with known dual meanings or those that could be perceived as unprofessional or inappropriate for the specific industry or message type (e.g., financial advice messages should likely avoid most emojis, whereas a fashion retail promotion might use them more liberally).   
F. Creating "Chaotic" Messages

The Problem: Even if individual formatting elements are technically correct, a message can still be ineffective if its overall structure is poor, leading to a "chaotic" or difficult-to-follow experience for the user. This relates to the logical flow of information and the overall message design, not just isolated formatting choices.   
LLM Avoidance Strategy:
The LLM should focus on creating a logical flow of information within the message.
Formatting should be used to support and enhance this structure (e.g., using lists for related items, paragraph breaks to separate distinct ideas), rather than being applied merely for decorative purposes.
Ensure a clear hierarchy of information, with the most important points made prominent through appropriate formatting.
To proactively address these potential issues, the following table outlines common pitfalls and suggests mitigation strategies for the LLM:

Table 3: Common Formatting Pitfalls and LLM Mitigation Strategies

Pitfall Description	Example of Error	Potential Negative Impact (Readability, Rejection, Perception)	LLM Avoidance Rule/Strategy	Relevant WhatsApp Guideline (if applicable)
Overuse of Formatting	*EVERYTHING* is *IMPORTANT* and *URGENT*!!!	Reduced readability, unprofessional, "spammy" appearance, dilutes actual emphasis.	Limit % of bolded text; cap emoji count (e.g., 1-2 per message); use emphasis selectively.	General best practice.
Accessibility Issues (Emoji Misuse)	Using emojis as bullet points: <br>🍎 Feature 1 <br>🍌 Feature 2	Confusing for screen readers, may not convey meaning to visually impaired users.	Place emojis at end of phrases; do not use as structural elements like bullets; limit quantity.	General accessibility best practice.
Syntax Errors (e.g., Mismatched Characters)	*This text is not closed for bold. _Or this for italic.	Formatting fails, special characters appear literally, looks unprofessional.	Rigorous syntax training; automated validation checks for opening/closing characters and correct symbols.	Basic formatting syntax.
Incorrect Spacing with Lists	*Item1 (no space after asterisk) <br> 1.Item2 (no space after period)	List may not render correctly, poor readability.	Enforce space after list markers (*, -, 1.).	WhatsApp list syntax.
Template Violation: Placeholder at Start/End of Body	{{1}} Your order is confirmed. OR Your order is confirmed {{1}}	Template rejection.	Hard rule: Message body must not start or end with a placeholder. Frame with static text.	WhatsApp Template Guidelines.
Template Violation: Formatting in Text Header	Template Header: *Special Offer!*	Template rejection.	Hard rule: No formatting markup (bold, italics), asterisks, or emojis in Text Headers.	WhatsApp Template Guidelines.
Template Violation: Non-Sequential Placeholders	Body: Hello {{1}}, your code is {{3}}. (missing {{2}})	Template rejection.	Hard rule: Placeholders must be sequential (e.g., {{1}}, {{2}}, {{3}}).	WhatsApp Template Guidelines.
Template Violation: Excessive Newlines	Line 1\n\n\nLine 2 (three newlines)	Template rejection.	Hard rule: Limit consecutive newline characters (\n) to a maximum of two.	WhatsApp Template Guidelines.
Emoji Misinterpretation	Using a culturally specific or ambiguous emoji (e.g., 🍆 in a professional context)	Offense, confusion, negative brand perception.	Use a pre-approved "safe list" of universally understood emojis; prioritize clarity over cleverness; consider context and brand voice.	General communication best practice.
Inconsistent Formatting Style	CTA is bold in one message, italic in another, plain in a third.	Confuses users, reduces predictability, looks unprofessional.	Define and enforce a consistent style guide for formatting similar information types (CTAs, alerts, product names).	Brand consistency principles.
  
VI. LLM Implementation: Training for Formatting Excellence
Translating these guidelines into an LLM that consistently produces expertly formatted WhatsApp messages requires a multifaceted approach, combining rule-based constraints with sophisticated learning techniques. The goal is an LLM that not only adheres to syntax and platform policies but also demonstrates a nuanced understanding of B2C communication strategy.

A. Translating Guidelines into LLM Instructions

A hybrid strategy is likely the most effective path to achieving "expert" status for the LLM. Purely rule-based systems might prove too rigid to handle the diverse and nuanced nature of B2C dialogue, while purely learning-based systems, if not adequately constrained, could inadvertently violate strict WhatsApp template policies or develop undesirable formatting habits.

Rule-Based Approaches: These are essential for non-negotiable aspects.

Syntax Adherence: Hard-code the correct syntax for all WhatsApp formatting types (e.g., *text* for bold, _text_ for italics). This forms the LLM's foundational formatting capability.
WhatsApp Policy Compliance: Implement strict, unalterable rules for all WhatsApp template guidelines. This includes correct placeholder usage ({{1}}), sequential ordering of placeholders, restrictions on placeholder placement (not at the beginning or end of the body), limitations on newlines and consecutive spaces, and the prohibition of formatting in text headers. These rules act as a critical filter or governor on the LLM's output.   
Example-Based Learning (Few-Shot/Many-Shot Prompts):

Provide the LLM with numerous, high-quality examples of "good" and "bad" formatted B2C messages across various scenarios (e.g., welcome messages, order confirmations, promotional offers, support interactions).
These examples should be annotated to explain why a particular formatting choice is good or bad in that context, linking back to the principles of clarity, emphasis, tone, and CTA effectiveness. For instance, a "good" example might show a well-placed bold CTA, while a "bad" example might show overuse of bolding that makes the message hard to read.
Fine-Tuning (If Applicable):

If a general-purpose base LLM is being used, fine-tuning it on a curated dataset of expertly formatted WhatsApp B2C messages is highly recommended. This dataset should be rich in variety and meticulously crafted to reflect all the principles and best practices outlined in this guideline.
The fine-tuning process helps the LLM internalize the patterns and nuances of effective formatting within the specific domain of WhatsApp B2C communication.
Instructional Prompts:

Develop detailed and context-aware prompts to guide the LLM's formatting choices for any given raw message content. These prompts should ideally include:
The raw text of the message.
The message's objective (e.g., drive a sale, provide information, resolve an issue).
The intended tone (e.g., urgent, friendly, formal, empathetic).
Key information to emphasize (e.g., order number, discount, deadline).
Any specific constraints or brand voice considerations.
Example prompt structure: "Format the following shipping update for WhatsApp. Emphasize the tracking number and the estimated delivery date using bold. Maintain a helpful and reassuring tone. Raw message: Your package with tracking XZY123 will arrive by June 15th."
B. Key Considerations for the AI Developer

Contextual Understanding: The LLM's ability to make "expert" formatting choices hinges on its capacity to understand the context of the message. This may involve analyzing the message content itself, associated metadata (e.g., message type, campaign ID), customer segment information, or even previous interaction history. The deeper its contextual understanding, the more appropriate its formatting decisions will be.
Variable Handling: As highlighted previously, robust and error-free logic for formatting text that includes dynamic variables (placeholders like {{1}} or {{customer_name}}) is absolutely crucial. The LLM must correctly place formatting characters around these variables without breaking the syntax or causing the variable itself to be misinterpreted. For example, *{{order_id}}* is correct, while *{{order_id*}} or {{*order_id*}} might fail.
Prioritization of Rules: A clear hierarchy of rules must be established within the LLM's logic.
WhatsApp Policy Rules: These are paramount and non-negotiable. Violations lead to message rejection.
Clarity and Readability Rules: Formatting should always enhance, never detract from, the ease of understanding.
Stylistic and Emphasis Rules: Choices about bolding, italics, emojis, etc., for emphasis or tone are subordinate to policy and clarity.
Iterative Refinement: Formatting is a nuanced aspect of communication. The LLM's initial performance will likely require ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and refinement based on the quality of its output, feedback from human reviewers, and potentially A/B testing results.
C. Testing and Iteration Strategies for LLM Formatting Output

Achieving "perfect" and "expert" formatting is an iterative process. The testing phase is not merely about identifying and fixing bugs but about refining the LLM's "judgment" and its ability to make qualitatively sound formatting decisions that align with B2C communication best practices.

Syntax Validation: Implement automated checks to ensure that all formatting applied by the LLM adheres to the correct WhatsApp syntax (e.g., matching asterisks for bold, correct list initiation).
Visual Review: Conduct thorough human reviews of a diverse set of LLM-formatted messages. This review should be done across different devices (iOS, Android) and WhatsApp clients (mobile, web, desktop) to check for consistent and correct rendering.
A/B Testing (Optional but Highly Recommended): For key message types, especially those with CTAs or critical information, consider A/B testing different formatting approaches generated by the LLM. For example, test a CTA in bold versus a CTA in bold with a guiding emoji to see which version yields better click-through rates or desired actions. This data can then be used to further refine the LLM's formatting strategies.   
Compliance Checks: Before deploying any message templates formatted by the LLM, rigorously test them against WhatsApp's validation criteria to ensure they will not be rejected. This might involve using sandbox environments or specific testing tools provided by WhatsApp Business API providers.
Qualitative Assessment: Human evaluators should assess messages not just for technical correctness but also against criteria such as: "Does this formatting enhance the message's primary goal?", "Does the formatting align with our brand voice and the intended tone?", "Is the formatting clear and easy to understand, or does it feel cluttered?". This qualitative feedback is vital for calibrating the LLM's more subtle decision-making processes.
D. Maintaining the Formatting Logic

The digital communication landscape is not static. WhatsApp may introduce new formatting features, update its existing ones, or modify its policies regarding message templates and content. Therefore, the LLM's formatting logic cannot be a "set it and forget it" system. A plan for ongoing maintenance and updates is essential to ensure continued compliance and effectiveness. This includes monitoring WhatsApp's official developer documentation and community channels for any relevant changes.

This table provides a focused checklist for the critical area of message template compliance, derived from official guidelines and common rejection reasons. Adherence is crucial to prevent message rejection and maintain a healthy sender status.   

Guideline Category	Specific WhatsApp Rule	LLM Implementation Check (Ensure LLM...)
Placeholders (Variables)	Must use double curly braces: {{1}}.	...generates placeholders with correct {{ }} syntax only.
Must be sequential (e.g., {{1}}, {{2}}, {{3}}). No gaps.	...verifies placeholder sequence or is programmed to generate them sequentially.
Cannot be directly adjacent (e.g., {{1}}{{2}} is invalid).	...ensures static text or space separates placeholders.
Body of the message cannot start or end with a placeholder.	...always frames placeholders with static text at the beginning and end of the message body.
Newlines are forbidden within placeholders.	...does not attempt to insert newline characters inside a placeholder definition.
Headers (Text Type)	Cannot contain emojis.	...is prohibited from adding emojis to Text Headers.
Cannot contain asterisks (*) or other formatting markup (bold, italics).	...is prohibited from applying any WhatsApp formatting characters (e.g., *, _, ~, `) to Text Headers.
Cannot contain the newline character (\n).	...is prohibited from inserting newline characters into Text Headers.
Message Body	Cannot have more than two consecutive newline characters (\n\n).	...limits consecutive newlines to a maximum of two.
No more than 4 consecutive spaces are allowed.	...is programmed to avoid generating more than four consecutive spaces.
General Content	Template purpose must be clear, concise, and well-written. Avoid vague content.	...is guided by prompts and training data that emphasize clarity and specificity in message content that will be formatted.
Grammatical or spelling mistakes should be avoided (can lead to rejection).	... (While primarily a content issue, formatting should not introduce errors) ensures formatted output maintains grammatical integrity.
Language selected for the template must match the language of the content.	... (If LLM handles multi-language) ensures consistency between declared language and formatted content language.
Avoid content identical to another existing template.	... (If LLM generates template variations) ensures sufficient differentiation to avoid duplication flags.
